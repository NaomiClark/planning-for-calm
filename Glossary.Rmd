title: "Glossary"

There is a lot of specific mindfulness terms you might encounter so we've put together this handy glossary - we hope it's helpful!


### A

#####Acceptance
<p>
Sometimes people can associate 'acceptance' with passivity or 'giving up', in such that accepting our thoughts means that we are OK with them and don't try to change them. This is a misconception and something that even experienced meditators need to occassionally remind themselves of: acceptance does mean that we approve of the thoughts or that we like them or that we have given up trying to change them. What it means for meditators is the acceptance of their existance. We can accept that a thought exists but we don't have to like it.
To put it another way... we can accept that pineapple pizza toppings exist, but that doesn't mean that we must like them.
<br>

By accepting that the thoughts or distractions exist, we can acknowledge their presence and from there be in a better position to change how we respond to them.

Some individuals may find that imagining a sunset or placing themselves sitting on a beach or even with a loved one or pet can help them to feel a little calmer and enter into a mindful state more easily. It can help to visualise thoughts as objects that can float away to emphasise the temporary, fleeting nature of thoughts such as letting go of balloons or watching leaves float down a river...

title: "Why Mindfulness?"
---

<br>

Mental health problems on university campuses are one the rise, with around 87% of students reporting suffering from stress (National Union of Students, 2016). We believe that practice mindfulness may offer some support to students to help them navigate student life and manage stress.

<br>

###Effects of Mindfulness

"I do feel less stressed… I might have a pile of problems… but taking that time [for] myself [to be] mindful… make[s] me feel better." (L., student)

<br>
*Please note that these effects are not guaranteed as each individual's experience with mindfulness is different and neither are they, nor mindfulness, intended to be a replacement for seeking medical advice.*

<br>

####For Students
*   Multiple benefits for students (Solhaug et al., 2016)
*   Act to reduce stress, depression and anxiety (Cavanagh et al, 2013; de Vibe et al., 2015; Kerrigan et al., 2017)
*   Help reduce distractibility (Miller et al., 2018)
*   Lower social anxiety (Tan et al., 2018)
*   Improve sleep problems (Greeson et al., 2011)
*   Mindfulness can act as a preventative measure, as a “defense” against future stress (de Vibe et al., 2015)

###read some books about mindfulness
A general good place to start is with any introductory or beginners book. This may seem obvious but it's good to remind ourselves that we won't become advanced overnight!

*   Great instroductory books include **"Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world"** by Prof. Mark Williams and Dr. Danny Penman.

*   For a read about integrating mindfulness into daily life, we'd recommend **"This is happening"** by Rohan Gunatillake.

*   Wanting an overview of the science? Check out **"The Science of Meditation"** by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson.

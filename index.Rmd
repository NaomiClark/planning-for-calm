####*We invite students to pause during their day, take a few breaths and be mindful in the present moment...*

<br>

Planning for Calm is a project set up by the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow and aims to provide resources for students to learn about mindfulness, its potential benefits and how it can be integrated into the hectic student lifestyle. We also hope to provide resources for lecturers and staff who are interested in incorporating mindfulness into their courses and other aspects of work.

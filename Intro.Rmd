title: "What is Mindfulness?"
---

<br>


####*Mindfulness can mean many things to many people. Attention. Relaxation. Focus.* 

<br>

#####There are many definitions of mindfulness...

At Planning for Calm we use one of the most well-known and widely-used definition: the ability to deliberately redirect attention without judgement to the present moment (Kabat-Zinn, 1994).

<br>
<br>

#####Here are some definitions offered by students

<br>

"I thought I knew what mindfulness was... I thought it was about trying to clear your mind and not think of anything but... it's more about recognising [thoughts] and pulling yourself back to the breath"

<br>

"Mindfulness isn't just sitting down and calming yourself... it's simultaneously more active and passive than that... it is about focussed attention"

<br>

"It's just taking that time to... reset yourself, just to get back to 'normal' levels, to reduce that anxiety or stress... to be centred"

<br>

"It's taking that time [for] myself... what thoughts are coming into my head or how my body feels..."
